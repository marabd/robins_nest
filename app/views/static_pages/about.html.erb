<h1>StaticPages#about</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Robin's Nest, where the firm belief is strictly held that all sandwiches are NOT created equal. Salt Lake City local and native Robin Paluso has brought to downtown --and put her on--an awe-inspiringly unique (yet still familiar) favorite American lunch cuisine... The Sandwich.</p>

<p>By using only the best ingredients and having practiced the culinary arts for years, Robin has founded right in downtown Salt Lake City her ideal for this American favorite.</p>

<p>The Robin's Nest is proud to say there are loyal devotees to virtually every sandwich on the menu. "You can taste the difference" is a common remark from first-time customers.</p>

<p>There are many now-famous sandwiches like the Rooster Call, Robin's spin on a classic Southern chicken salad recipe: all white meat chicken breast, red grapes, cashews, provolone cheese, and Robin's sweet honey dijon on italian ciabatta. In reading, for some, it's a shock to the eyes-but invariably becomes a revelation to the taste buds.</p>
